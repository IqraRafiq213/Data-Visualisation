# Data-Visualisation
In this project, the Uber trip dataset from Kaggle used in this project. Each ride record typically includes attributes like pickup timestamp, dropoff timestamp, pickup location coordinates or region, etc. The notebook includes cleaning steps (e.g. handling missing values, formatting timestamps, aggregating, filtering).

I explore Uber trip data to answer questions like:

- How does demand vary over time (by day, hour, weekday vs weekend)?  
- Which areas see the most activity?  
- Are there discernible patterns (e.g. rush hour peaks, seasonality)?  
- What visualizations best illustrate these insights?
